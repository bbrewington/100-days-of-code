# 100-days-of-code
Tracking different 100 day chunks as I do the challenge described here: www.100daysofcode.com - 2 rules: 1) Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days. 2) Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

## Housekeeping

- Saving running notes here: [2023-apr-30-thru-aug-7.md](2023-apr-30-thru-aug-7.md).  If submit PR/Issue in other repos, link them in that markdown doc
- Also logging personal notes in a private Notion board

## Project Ideas (TODO)

- Build a Toggl Track --> Notion data pipeline (use: https://developers.track.toggl.com/docs/)
- Build a personal goal tracker (e.g. active calories per day)
- Refactor DS notebook code to modular OOP style
- Build a data engineering component library (with dbt as one option)
- Do same data pipeline with Pandas, Polars, PySpark, duckDB, Databricks, BigQuery (dbt & SP's), Snowflake (dbt & SP's)
